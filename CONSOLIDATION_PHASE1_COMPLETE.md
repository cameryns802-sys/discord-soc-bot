## Why Still at 100?
- Consolidations freed 10 slots (13 → 3 commands)
- But other newly-loaded cogs or unforeseen uses may have filled them
- OR: Discovery of additional commands that count toward limit

## Phase 2 - In Progress
Need to consolidate MORE to get below 85, then re-enable disabled cogs:
1. currency_system (5 commands) 
2. giveaway_system (3 commands)
3. daily_challenges (2 commands)
4. achievement_system (2 commands)
5. Knowledge_base (6 commands)

## Phase 3 - Final
Once below 85, re-enable the 4 high-value utility cogs:
1. reaction_roles (1 group - already consolidated)
2. reputation_system (2 groups - already consolidated)
3. sentiment_trend_analysis (1 group - already consolidated)
4. starboard (1 group - already consolidated)

**Total new commands from disabled**: ~7 commands (already in groups format)
**Target final count**: <92 commands (leaving headroom)
