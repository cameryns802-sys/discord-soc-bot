Automated monitoring alerts\n2. User reports via security@ channel\n3. Threat intelligence feed matching\n4. Behavioral analytics anomalies\n5. SIEM correlation rules\n\n### Alert Triggers\n- Alerts pattern detected by AI systems\n- Multiple IOC matches\n- Threshold exceeded on suspicious activity\n- Manual analyst escalation\n\n## TRIAGE PHASE\n### Initial Assessment Questions\n1. How many users/systems are affected?\n2. Is the threat actively spreading?\n3. Has data been accessed or exfiltrated?\n4. Are critical systems at risk?\n5. Is this part of a larger campaign?\n\n### Severity Classification\n**CRITICAL:** Multiple systems, active spread, data exfiltration confirmed\n**HIGH:** Single system, potential for spread, sensitive data at risk\n**MEDIUM:** Contained incident, no data exposure, limited impact\n**LOW:** Suspicious activity, no confirmed compromise, preventive action\n\n## RESPONSE PHASE\n### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)\n1. Assess scope\n2. Contain threat\n3. Preserve evidence\n4. Document actions\n5. Escalate as needed\n\n### Containment Actions (15-60 minutes)\n1. Implement network segmentation\n2. Apply temporary firewall rules\n3. Disable affected accounts\n4. Monitor for lateral movement\n5. Coordinate with affected teams\n\n### Eradication Actions (1-4 hours)\n1. Remove malicious artifacts\n2. Patch vulnerabilities\n3. Update security controls\n4. Verify IOC removal\n5. Conduct security scan\n\n## RECOVERY PHASE\n1. Restore from clean backups if needed\n2. Re-enable accounts with new credentials\n3. Monitor for re-infection\n4. Resume normal operations gradually\n5. Update detection rules\n\n## POST-INCIDENT PHASE\n1. Conduct after-action review\n2. Update playbook with lessons learned\n3. User training on prevention\n4. Implement recommended controls\n5. Share threat intelligence with community\n\n## ESCALATION CRITERIA\n**Escalate to Senior Analyst:** Multiple systems compromised\n**Escalate to Management:** Data breach confirmed\n**Escalate to Legal:** Regulatory notification required\n**Escalate to Executive:** Business-critical impact\n\n## TOOLS & RESOURCES\n- SIEM platform\n- EDR/XDR solution\n- Forensics toolkit\n- Threat intelligence feeds\n- Case management system\n- Communication platform\n\n## AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES\n\u2705 Automatic alerts detection via AI\n\u2705 Auto-quarantine of affected accounts\n\u2705 Automated evidence collection\n\u2705 SOAR playbook execution\n\u26a0\ufe0f Manual review still required for: Escalation decisions, Legal notifications\n\n---\n*Auto-generated playbook - Review and customize for your environment*\n"
