=== SETUP WORKFLOW ===

1. Bot admin runs !setup_soc

   ✓ Confirms completion

2. Assign roles to team members
   ✓ Based on job function
   ✓ Permissions auto-configured

3. Assign channels to roles
   ✓ Configure further as needed
   ✓ Pin important guides

4. Start using security commands
   ✓ Commands now have proper context
   ✓ Alerts go to right channels
   ✓ DMs notify team

=== DATA STORAGE ===

/data/
  ├── server_setups.json      # Setup configuration per guild
  ├── dm_queue.json           # Pending DMs to send
  └── dm_log.json             # DM send history & status

=== PERMISSIONS SUMMARY ===

User who ran !setup_soc must have:
  ✓ Administrator permission
